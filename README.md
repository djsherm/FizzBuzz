# FizzBuzz
My attempt at completing Tom Scott's programming challenge of coding the children's game "FizzBuzz" (video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc)
The divisors where words are said instead of the counted integer are stored in the vector "speak".
The corresponding words that are to be said instead of the current number are stored in "shout" and are printed.
Additional functionality inclused numbers that would normally have a word shouted, but have been overridden.  These divisors are stored in "noSpeak".
